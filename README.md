# Taboolingo 🥖 / 🍵 / 🍺 / 💃

A web-based multi-language learning game inspired by the classic Taboo game. Players must describe words in **French, English, German, or Spanish** without using forbidden "taboo" words, making it an engaging way to practice vocabulary and communication skills. Optimized for all ages, from students to seniors.

### 🌐 Online Multiplayer (Play from Anywhere)
*Best for playing with friends on their own devices.*

1. **Setup**: One player clicks **"🌐 Online Multiplayer"** -> "Create Room" and shares the 4-character code (e.g., "AB12").
2. **Join**: Other players enter the room code and their name to join.
3. **Start Game**: The host selects the **Language**, level, and **Timer Mode**, then starts the session once everyone is in.
4. **Take Turns**: 
   - **2-3 Players**: Turn-based - one player describes, the others guess.
   - **4+ Players**: Team-based - the game automatically splits you into Team A and Team B.
5. **Active Player**: When it's your turn, click **"Start Your Round"**.
6. **Buzzer Duty**: Opposing players can see your card. If they hear you say a taboo word, they'll BUZZ you!

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Local Mode
Simply open `index.html` in your web browser. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Testing Local Data Changes**: Modern browsers block `fetch` requests to local files (CORS policy) when opening `index.html` via the `file:///` protocol. To test local changes to CSV files (like `french_words.csv`), you must run a simple web server:
> - **Python**: `python -m http.server`
> - **Node/npm**: `npx serve`
> - **VS Code**: Use the "Live Server" extension.
>
> Once running, access the game via `http://localhost:8000` (or similar).

### Online Mode Setup
Multiplayer mode uses Firebase for synchronization. 

1. **Configure Firebase**: Update the `firebaseConfig` in `index.html` with your project's keys.
2. **Restrict API Key**: For security, ensure your API key is restricted to your domain in the Google Cloud Console.
3. **Launch**: Share the URL with your friends and start playing!
